**Beschreibung:**

Within the AudioGames Project in 2016 there was the need to make the player feel a crash with a virtual object. Another requirement was to be able to send signals via buttons. So I developed gloves with buttons and vibration modules that are able to communicate with a raspberrypi gateway using the CoAP Protocoll over the wireless 802.15.4 Network (6LowPAN). The raspberrypi should also be connected to the LAN and (in this case) receives and sends data via the OSC-Protocoll. On the sensor node I uses RIOT-OS which made it fun to use all sorts of libraries and made hardware access very easy. Thanks to the RIOT team in hamburg for their help!

This code is meant for students that need a working example of how to implement CoAP on a node that uses Riot.
